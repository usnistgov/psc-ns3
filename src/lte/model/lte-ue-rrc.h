 * This delay exists because of racing condition between several UE measurements
 * functions which happen to be scheduled at the same time. The delay ensures
 * that:
 *  - measurements (e.g., layer-3 filtering) are always performed before
 *    reporting, thus the latter always use the latest measured RSRP and RSRQ;
 *    and
 *  - time-to-trigger check is always performed before the reporting, so there
 *    would still be chance for it to cancel the reporting if necessary.

   * Implements Section 5.5.5 "Measurement reporting" of 3GPP TS 36.331.
   * Producing a *measurement report* involves several tasks such as:
   * - including the measurement results of the serving cell into the report;
   * - selecting some neighbour cells which triggered the reporting (i.e., those
   *   in *cellsTriggeredList*) to be included in the report;
   * - sorting the order of neighbour cells in the report by their RSRP or RSRQ
   *   measurement results (the highest comes first); and
   * - ensuring the number of neighbour cells in the report is under the
   *   *maxReportCells* limit defined by the measurement identity's reporting
   *   configuration.
   *
   * The RSRP and RSRQ measurement results included in the report are expressed
   * in 3GPP-specified range format. They are converted from dBm and dB units
   * using EutranMeasurementMapping::Dbm2RsrpRange and
   * EutranMeasurementMapping::Db2RsrqRange functions.
   *
   * Measurement report is submitted to the serving eNodeB through the *RRC
   * protocol*. The LteUeRrcSapUser::SendMeasurementReport method of the *UE RRC
   * SAP* facilitates this submission.
   *
   * After the submission, the function will repeat itself after a certain
   * interval. The interval length may vary from 120 ms to 60 minutes and is
   * determined by the *report interval* parameter specified by the measurement
   * identity's reporting configuration.
