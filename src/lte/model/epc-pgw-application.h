 *
 * This Application implements the PGW side of the S5 interface between
 * the PGW node and the SGW nodes and the PGW side of the SGi interface between
 * the PGW node and the internet hosts. It supports the following functions and messages:
 *
 *  - S5 connectivity (i.e. GTPv2-C signalling and GTP-U data plane)
 *  - Bearer management functions including dedicated bearer establishment
 *  - Per-user based packet filtering
 *  - UL and DL bearer binding
 *  - Tunnel Management messages
 *
 * Others functions enumerated in section 4.4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 are not supported.
